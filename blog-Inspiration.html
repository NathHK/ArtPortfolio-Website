            <h1>Music: Bloodborne</h1>
            <time datetime="2018-04-08">04/08/18</time>
            
            <div class="content">
                <p>When I have work to get done, music helps keep me focused. However, if I have to tab in and out to skip songs or change the playlist, it creates an opportunity for distractions. For large projects such as building this website, I tend to listen to video game soundtracks; they're multiple hours long and often keep a consistent vibe, which I especially like for when I'm working on a drawing. </p>
                <p>At the top of my list of go-to game compositions is Bloodborne. For those not familiar with the game, this 2015 PlayStation 4 title is well known for its cut-throat gameplay and gorgeously gloomy atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Bloodborne's soundtrack has gained a lot of praise for its role in establishing the game's mood. The project's production spanned over two years and accross three different continents, and includes performances by a 65-piece orchestra and a 32-member choir.</p>
                <p>What I find incredible about this soundtrack is its ability to relay a range of intense emotions, even when listened to separate from the video game it was created for. From the eariness of a lone music box, to the heart-racing buildup of a boss fight's crescrendo, Bloodborne's soundtrack never fails to give me the kind of chills that a music lover could only hope for from such a production.</p>
                <p>For more information about the soundtrack's making, I suggest <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2015/05/18/the-story-behind-bloodbornes-haunting-soundtrack/">this interview</a>, which includes words from one of the game's composers, Ryan Amon, and a few members of FromSoftware's sound team.</p>
