# ArtPortfolio-Website

Website I designed and developed in 2018 using HTML and CSS.

## Note:

[gen_validatorv4.js](gen_validatorv4.js) is a free script from [JavaScript-Coder.com](https://www.javascript-coder.com/) (see the file's intro lines for details). I took no part in writing it. 

When I developed my website, I created a "Contact Me" page so that viewers could, theoretically, send me feedback about the website and my artwork. Since the web development course I was taking (for which I submitted this website as my final project) did not delve into JavaScript or PHP, I was not required to provide form-to-email functionality. That said, if I ever decide to implement it, the framework is there.

As an aside, I did write a short JavaScript program for my website which allows viewers to click-through images of my artwork. It is included in both [portfolio-finished.html](portfolio-finished.html) and [portfolio-sketches.html](portfolio-sketches.html).

## Plan Going Forward:

This website currently stands as a **finished** project. While I would like to have an online portfolio that I've made from scratch (both for the fun of development and as a display of my skills), there are other projects and responsibilities higher on my To-Do List. If I ever decide to return to this website and commit to keeping it up-to-date, I'll update this README accordingly.
