        <section> <p>My name is Nathan Kalafut and I'm nineteen, meaning that I don't have a whole lot of artistic experience under my belt, at least in terms of work I'd consider proper. This being said, I've been a fan of art since I was super little, back in the days of finger-painting and Thanksgiving hand-turkeys. I'd like to think that I've improved since the time I was five, but art tends to be subjective.</p> 
        <p>I am currently taking a course through Empire State University called, &quot;Introduction to Web Publishing with HTML.&quot; For a final project, I was tasked with creating a website, so I decided to take something I've spent a lot of time on and spend a lot of time building a site for it!</p></section>
        
        <header id="site"><img src="Images/aboutThisWebsite.png"></header>
        
        <section> <p>The initial idea I had for this website was to build a kind of expanded art portfolio. Rather than putting together a website that's hyper professional and solely focused on displaying talent to hypothetical consumers, I wanted to incorporate sections for other aspects of the artistic process. Aside from displaying what I consider to be the best of my work, I'm also including pictures of sketchbook drawings and posting written discussions about sources of inspiration, elements of design, and other art related topics.</p> 
	    <p>This being said, the main purpose of my website is to get my ideas out in the open and my art in a place where it wonâ€™t sit around collecting dust. If I ever do decide that I want to try and earn some kind of living from my art, I need to actually have it seen. Either way, I feel better having my work exist somewhere other than a storage bin.</p> </section>
